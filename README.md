📊 Customer Churn Analysis using Python

This project performs an end-to-end analysis of customer churn for a telecom company using Python. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and identification of key churn drivers. The objective is to understand customer behavior and provide insights that can help reduce churn.

🚀 Project Overview

Cleaned and prepared raw telecom customer data

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualized churn patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Analyzed customer demographics, contract types, payment methods, and service usage

Highlighted high-risk churn segments

Derived actionable business insights

The entire analysis, Python code, and generated charts are included inside the Jupyter Notebook.

🧹 Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned and prepared by:

Handling missing values

Converting categorical columns

Mapping binary fields (e.g., SeniorCitizen: 0 → No, 1 → Yes)

Converting data types

Removing inconsistencies in labels

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key areas analyzed include:

Overall churn rate

Churn by gender

Churn by senior citizens

Contract type impact on churn

Tenure and churn patterns

Internet service usage

Payment method analysis

Visualizations are included for every segment to simplify interpretation.

📌 Key Insights

Overall churn rate is 26.54% — roughly 1 in 4 customers leave.

Senior citizens churn at a higher percentage compared to younger customers.

Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn, while long-term contracts have the lowest.

Customers using electronic check payments churn significantly more than those using credit cards or automatic bank transfers.

Short-tenure customers (1–2 months) have extremely high churn rates, indicating onboarding issues.

Customers without security, technical support, or protection services are more likely to churn.
